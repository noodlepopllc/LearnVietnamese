        "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice\n\u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d\n",
        "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\n",
        "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
        "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n",
        "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n",
        "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it."

                "Nothing so remarkable; nor did Alice think that it was very hard to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh my God! Oh my God! I'm going to be late!\"\u201d (when she thought about it then, it occurred to her that she should have wondered this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a clock out of its waistcoat pocket, and looked at it, and then hurriedly, Alice began to get up, as it flashed in her mind that she had never seen a rabbit with a waistcoat pocket, or a clock to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was only in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the fence.",
                "In a moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in her world it was to get again.",
                "The rabbit hole went straight as a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice did not have a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling into a very deep well.",
                "Either the well is very deep, or it falls very slowly, because it has a lot of time when it comes down to look around and wonder what will happen next. First, it tries to look down and realize what it is coming to, but it is too dark to see anything; then it looks at the edges of the well, and notices that they have been filled with cabinets and bookshelves; here and there she sees maps and pictures hanging on the pegs. She takes down a jar from one of the shelves as she passes by; it is labeled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but her great disappointment is that it is empty: she does not like to drop the jar for fear of killing someone underneath, so she puts it in one of the cabinets as she falls through it."
